## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OmarShamkh/vending_machine_api.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd vending-machine-api
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

5. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Generate a SECRET_KEY for the Django application. You can use a random string generator tool or generate one manually. Replace the placeholder `YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE` in the `.env.example` file with your generated secret key.
    
    ```bash
    mv .env.example .env
    ```

7. Run database migrations:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```

8. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```
